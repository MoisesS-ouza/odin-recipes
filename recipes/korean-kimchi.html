    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <div class="list_div">
    <ul class="list">
      <li>3 heads napa cabbage, cored and cut into quarters lengthwise</li>
      <li>1/2 cup salt</li>
      <li>3 heads garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 bunch green onions, cut into 2 inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons monosodium glutamate (MSG)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>

  <div class="list_div">
    <ol class="list">
      <li>Cut the cabbage leaves into 2 inch long pieces. Spread 1/4 of the leaves into a large, non-metallic bowl and sprinkle with 1/4 of the salt. Repeat layering all of the cabbage has been salted. Let stand at room temperature until a lot of liquid has been pulled from the leaves and the cabbage is tender, 3 to 4 hours; drain. Rinse the cabbage in 2 or 3 changes of water. Drain again very well and return the cabbage to the mixing bowl.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle the cabbage with the minced garlic, green onions, MSG, and red pepper flakes. Season to taste with additional salt and toss until evenly combined. Pack the mixture into a sterilized gallon-sized glass jar. Cover the jar with wax paper and a loose fitting lid so the seal is not airtight.</li>
      <li>Allow the cabbage to ferment at room temperature until it reaches the desired degree of sourness, 2 to 5 days. Store in an airtight jar in the refrigerator.</li>
    </ol>
