    <h2>Description</h2>
  
    <p><strong>Kimchi</strong> is a traditional Korean dish made from <strong>fermented vegetables</strong>, most commonly napa cabbage and Korean radishes, with a variety of seasonings such as chili pepper, garlic, ginger, and fish sauce. It is known for its distinctive spicy, tangy flavor and probiotic benefits due to the fermentation process.

    <p>It's a staple in Korean cuisine and is typically served as a side dish, but it can also be used as an ingredient in other dishes like soups, stews, and fried rice. It has various regional and seasonal variations, depending on the type of vegetables and seasonings used.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>3 heads napa cabbage, cored and cut into quarters lengthwise</li>
      <li>1/2 cup salt</li>
      <li>3 heads garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 bunch green onions, cut into 2 inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons monosodium glutamate (MSG)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Cut the cabbage leaves into 2 inch long pieces. Spread 1/4 of the leaves into a large, non-metallic bowl and sprinkle with 1/4 of the salt. Repeat layering all of the cabbage has been salted. Let stand at room temperature until a lot of liquid has been pulled from the leaves and the cabbage is tender, 3 to 4 hours; drain. Rinse the cabbage in 2 or 3 changes of water. Drain again very well and return the cabbage to the mixing bowl.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle the cabbage with the minced garlic, green onions, MSG, and red pepper flakes. Season to taste with additional salt and toss until evenly combined. Pack the mixture into a sterilized gallon-sized glass jar. Cover the jar with wax paper and a loose fitting lid so the seal is not airtight.</li>
      <li>Allow the cabbage to ferment at room temperature until it reaches the desired degree of sourness, 2 to 5 days. Store in an airtight jar in the refrigerator.</li>
    </ol>
