    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p><strong>Ramen</strong> is a Japanese noodle soup dish that consists of <strong>Chinese-style wheat noodles</strong> served in a flavorful broth, often topped with ingredients like sliced pork (chashu), soft-boiled eggs, green onions, nori (seaweed), and bamboo shoots. The broth can be based on a variety of flavors, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shoyu (soy sauce)</strong>: A soy sauce-based broth that is light and savory.</li>
      <li><strong>Miso</strong>: A broth made with fermented soybean paste, giving it a rich and slightly tangy flavor.</li>
      <li><strong>Shio (salt)</strong>: A light and clear broth, typically made with a base of chicken or seafood.</li>
      <li><strong>Tonkotsu</strong>: A rich, creamy broth made by simmering pork bones for hours until they break down, resulting in a thick, hearty soup.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>4 cups water</li>
      <li>8 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced, divided</li>

      <li>1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper</li>
      <li>2 (3 ounce) packages chicken-flavored ramen noodles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

      <li>Combine water, mushrooms, 1/2 the green onions, carrot, onion, soy sauce, garlic, Sriracha sauce, sesame oil, rice wine vinegar, white pepper, black pepper, and flavor packets from ramen in a large pot.

    </ol>
