    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p><strong>Mochi</strong> is a traditional Japanese food made from glutinous rice that is pounded into a sticky, elastic paste and then shaped into small round cakes. It has a chewy texture and a slightly sweet flavor. Mochi can be enjoyed on its own or with various fillings and toppings. They are commonly filled with red bean paste. Other ingredients include water, sugar and cornstarch. They can be molded into a desired shape.</p>
    
    <p>It can be seen as <strong>Plain Mochi</strong> - Simple and unflavored, <strong>Daifuku</strong> - Filled with sweetened red bean paste, <strong>Mochi Ice Cream</strong> - Filled with ice cream, etc. Today, it's going to be Daifuku, a mochi filled with red bean paste.</p>
